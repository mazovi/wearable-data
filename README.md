#Getting and Cleaning Wearable Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This repo includes: 1) a tidy data set as described by CodeBook.md, 2) a code book (CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that  performed to clean up the data, and (3) This README.md file.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
